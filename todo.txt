- log to mongodb!
- finish election
- send leader address to client
- do two phase commit
- write log file
- sync total data
- sync partial data
- encode values in a better way
- use logrotation and compression!

check different use cases:
	startup:
		if !is primary:
			get op log and replay database
			set ephemeral node or notify primary zerorpc
	Replica errors:
	ready fails
		see if child is alive - retry

	commit fails
		identify child:
			if child is still alive, restart child remotely
			else
			wait for child to restart and sync operations log

	Primary error:

	everybody child watches on ready
		new node comes up
		gets operations log from master
		updates database
		sets ephemeral node
